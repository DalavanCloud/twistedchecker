# Regular expression which should only match correct module names
# Modules must be named in all lower-case, or separated by underscores.
module-rgx=(([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*))$

# Regular expression which should only match correct method names
# Methods should be in mixed case, with the first letter lower case,
# each word separated by having its first letter capitalized.
# Some methods can have a prefix in all lower-case with a trailing underscore
# examples:
# testMethod, test, _test, get_testMethod(in special cases)
# bad examples:
# TestMethod, Test, TESTMETHOD, testMethod_of_foo

method-rgx=((([a-z_])|([a-z]+_[a-z]))[a-zA-Z0-9]+)$|(__[a-z]+__)$

# Regular expression which should only match correct instance attribute names
attr-rgx=((([a-z_])|([a-z]+_[a-z]))[a-zA-Z0-9]+)$
