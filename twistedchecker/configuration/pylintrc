[TYPECHECK]


[BASIC]

# Regular expression which should only match correct module names
# Modules must be named in all lower-case, or separated by underscores.
module-rgx=(([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*))$

# Regular expression which should only match correct method names
# Methods should be in mixed case, with the first letter lower case,
# each word separated by having its first letter capitalized.
# Some methods can have a prefix in all lower-case with a trailing underscore
# examples:
# testMethod, test, _test, get_testMethod(in special cases)
# bad examples:
# TestMethod, Test, TESTMETHOD, testMethod_of_foo

method-rgx=((([a-z_])|([a-z]+_[a-z]))[a-zA-Z0-9]+)$|(__[a-z]+__)$

# Regular expression which should only match correct instance attribute names
# Attribute names should be in mixed case, with the first letter lower case,
# each word separated by having its first letter capitalized just like method names.
# And all private names should begin with an underscore.
attr-rgx=((([a-z_])|([a-z]+_[a-z]))[a-zA-Z0-9]+)$

# Classes are to be named in mixed case, with the first letter capitalized,
# each word separated by having its first letter capitalized.
class-rgx=([A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+)$

# Regular expression which should only match correct variable names
# good variable names:
# f, foo, _foo, fooBar
# bad variable names:
# FooBar, Foo, FOO, foo_bar
variable-rgx=([a-z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*)$
